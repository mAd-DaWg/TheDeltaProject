Scrapped for now


Goal:
Aiming to make an AI similar to JARVIS(from iron man) to control and interact with your pc. 

Update: exploring the use of FANN(homepage: http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/ github: https://github.com/libfann/fann)
        as a basis for the neuralnetworks and machine learning, which would save time and effort.

Code:
Developed in c# using monodevelop(when on linux) or MS Visual Studio(when on windows)

How to compile:
1. Open "TheDeltaProject.csproj" file by double clicking on it or opening it from the File>Open menu in your Dev environment.
2. Set the Active configuration to Release
3. From the build menu, choose build.

Note to linux users:  Makefiles for compiling the project will be implemented at a later stage, 
                      for now please Compile the project using Monodevelop.

How to run:
On Linux: right-click on the binary(bin/Release/TheDeltaProject.exe) and select the option similar to 
          "Open with Monodevelop console".
